We also provide performance and efficiency comparisons with different backbone networks,Table 1 presents the performance results of the
different methods on the three benchmark datasets where TDH-R101 indicates the use of the
ResNet101 backbone network and TDH-V-L-16 indicates the use of the ViT-L_16 backbone
network. Table 2 demonstrates the number of parameters and the computational effort of the
model under different backbone networks.
